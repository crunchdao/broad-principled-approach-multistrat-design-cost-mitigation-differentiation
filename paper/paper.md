# Introduction

The top multistrat funds (e.g. Citadel, Millennium Management, and Two Sigma) have long since passed the threshold of 1,000 non-investment personnel. The second tier (Exodus, Schonfeld, \dots) employ an order of magnitude less and some specialty firms might employ dozens only. 

The purpose of this document is to determine whether a radical rethinking of the core functionalities would enable a small new entrant (perhaps with an Eisler-like focus initially) to not only operate in this space but also, despite a seeming disparity, provide {\em more} decision making assistance in real-time than is currently received from even the largest players (such as Millenium or Point72).    

To do so may require replacing the traditional notion of a portfolio manager with an augmented modern variety: one hooked indirectly into thousands of data scientists around the world and one whose movements through trading environments, chats and third party applications such as Bloomberg or Haver are tracked and instrumented in new ways.

This new kind of human would be able to marry their experience, intuition and economic thesis creation with new kinds of heads up intelligence surgically delivered inside their workflow and powered behind the scenes by advanced model search and exogenous data suggestion. Moreover they would be able to grow their understanding of markets far more quickly than their colleagues, helped by technology such as autonomous price movement explanation driven by sell-side research. 

This new firm would deliver such a wow moment for prospective portfolio managers - akin to putting on ``prediction goggles'', that it would attract many of the top performers. By lifting the cognitive load of routine repetitive tasks and by obviating to a large degree the tedious and bespoke creation of forecasts this would enable portfolio managers to focus more. (They would also sleep more - one of numerous things that would be instrumented and fed back into their personalized analysis).   

And then, through completely re-thought skill assessment (and novel risk frameworks that replace normative modeling with crowd-sourced simulation, for example), their ability would translate more seamlessly and reliably into portfolio level investor returns. 

# Engineering principles

Achieving this goal may require notable discipline. Trying to be highly selective, discussion is limited to just two far-reaching principles (based on two decades of experience building analytics).  

## Bureaucracy is not the best meta-model

Analytics development is wedded far too heavily to the style of traditional software development and to the hierarchical approach by which companies are organized. The former confuses software robustness with statistical robustness, and the latter puts an immediate limit on performance.  

Any re-envisioned multistat firm with a combination of experienced people and intelligent machines will {\em of course} require disciplined software practice. But this engineering solidity is not at odds with a new core principle: that any mathematically informed piece of technology should be designed in such a way that {\em it can be improved by anyone in the world at any time without their asking permission to do so}. 

Because this ambition, with the emphasis on ``without asking permission'', is motivated at length in the microprediction \href{https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262047326/}{book} it will be treated more an an ansatz here, albeit one with quite profound implications. For instance: 

- Risk management should be much closer to the ideal of Monte Carlo path generation crowd-sourced in an inventive compatible manner (i.e. analogous to \href{https://www.monteprediction.com/}{Monte Prediction}) than to a traditional risk department fed by normative models.
- Internal work should have no special footing compared to algorithms sourced via offline contest cycles and algorithm capture (hosting), or by direct real-time crowd-sourcing. {\em All} predictive analytics should be farmed out to the crowd.
- This is not to suggest the firm lack mathematical culture - quite the opposite. Technique should be directed to the transformation of business problems into commodity prediction (as a first step, not an assessment afterthought). Examples include optimal routing, auction volume prediction, macro regime detection, curve prediction and economic nowcasting. 

Tools from control theory and reinforcement learning are to be treated as cues for sneaky ways to crowd-source, not an invitation to build entirely closed systems. 

Consequently, the core effort in technology should include frameworks to streamline this process including the creation of packages, patterns and frameworks for engineering systems where innovative contest and market-like mechanisms can help achieve this core principle.
